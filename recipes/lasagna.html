            Lasagna is a classic <em>Italian</em> dish that can be created in the comfort 
            of your own home. For me, Lasanga reminds me of my Mother's cooking. She was 
             never the main chef in our home, but when she was it was lasagna on the menu.

            In this article I will be teaching you the secrets to perfecting lasagna. While
            it may look like a glorified casarole, I can assure you there is much 
            more finesse involved.
